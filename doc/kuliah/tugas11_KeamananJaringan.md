Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection is a Virtual/virtual private nature that not everyone can access it. VPN has 3 main functions in the security of the data i.e., Confidentially (confidentiality of Data), Data Integrity (Data Integrity) and Origin Authentication (Authentication Source). Related to how a VPN works, VPN servers can work as a liaison between client. When the client accesses the data, the request will be encrypted by the VPN Client before it is sent to the VPN Server, for example, encrypted with A formula so that requests the data will contain the codes. After getting to the VPN Server, the data described by the Server with the formula A, having previously been configured between the server with the client, then the server will have the same algorit to read an encryption. Vice versa from the Server to the Client.
