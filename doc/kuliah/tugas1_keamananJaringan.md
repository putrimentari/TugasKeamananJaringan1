TCP/IP is the standardused for data communication in the process of exchange-traded data from one computer to another on the Internet. While the OSI communication standard is used in computer networks. It is this standard that makes the whole communication tools communicate with each other through the network. The OSI model Layer describes the information of software applications on a computer that moved past the media networks on a software application on another computer.
The OSI Layer model is conceptually divided into 7 layers and each layer has a specific function. While TCP/IP only has 4 layers. The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) created by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
